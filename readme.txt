== Description ==

= Welcome nRelate users! =

Our friends at nRelate recently announced that they will be discontinuing their popular nRelate for WordPress plugin and recommendations service. If you're joining us from nRelate, we'd like to thank you for choosing Related Posts by Zemanta!

Similar to nRelate, Related Posts by Zemanta brings new visitors to your site, helping you increase your reach and readership.

Related Posts is unique because it gives you the option to editorially curate related content for each post, or let Zemanta automatically recommend sources from around the web -- OR BOTH!

Here's a few other features you might enjoy:

* In-Text links recommendations from popular sources such as Wikipedia, IMDB, and YouTube
* Responsive themes for desktop, tablet, and mobile
* Like writing CSS? Customize Related Posts with your own code!

= Performance =

Our recommendations aren't database intensive, which is why we're not blacklisted by [WP Engine](http://wpengine.com/support/disallowed-plugins/). This also means better performance, not to mention you can set how far back you wish to index your articles in the plugin settings.

= Editorial support =

Zemanta offers users editorial support by enabling a Related articles widget. You manually choose the articles you wish to recommend to others. This way you reach out to other bloggers that write about similar topics - remember sharing is caring! =)

= Customizable themes =

Related Posts plugin comes with a lot of beautiful themes with different thumbnail sizes. You can even manually adjust the "look and feel" of the theme with custom CSS and other advanced settings. And if you bump into an obstacle, our Support team is happy to help you out, just [reach out](support@zemanta.com).

Customize the look and feel of Zemanta's Related Posts plugin by navigating to WordPress Dashboard > Settings > Related Posts by Zemanta

= nRelate Compatibility =
To simplify the transition, we added specific support for users switching from nRelate, so that our plugin will automatically use some of your old settings:

* number of posts to show in the widget
* related title above the widget
* show excerpts of articles or not
* max age of articles to be recommended
* thumbnail size
* default thumbnail

If you have any questions getting started, please let us know! Send us an email to support@zemanta.com. We'd love to hear from you.
